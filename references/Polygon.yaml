    <h3>What is Polygon?</h3>
    Previously known as the Matic Network, Polygon is both an L2 scaling solution for Ethereum and a standalone blockchain for dApp development. 
    The blockchain is widely used and preferred for its transaction speed, throughput, and EVM compatibility. <br/>
    <h3>How to use Polygon?</h3>
    <p>Polygon (Matic) is an Ethereum EVM 100% compatible blockchain, and is very good for decentralized application (Dapp) development within many possible verticals including DeFi, NFT, Gaming, and many others.<br/>
    Tatum supports 2 chains:
    <ul><li><b>Mainnet</b> - a regular live chain
    <li><b>Mumbai Testnet</b> - a chain used for testing purposes. Coins on the test chain have no value and can be obtained from
    a faucet, e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://faucet.matic.network/">https://faucet.matic.network/</a></li></ul></p>
    <h3>Polygon stats</h3>
    <b> Number of active addresses</b>: Around 400k (<a href="https://polygonscan.com/chart/active-address">Lets have a look at newest data here.</a>)<br/>
    <b> Gas fee</b>: Prices are <b>low</b>, but it also depends on the current market situation. (<a href="https://polygonscan.com/chart/gasprice">Lets have a look at newest data here.</a>).

        <h4>1 credit per API call.</h4><br/><p>Tatum supports BIP44 HD wallets. It is very convenient and secure, since it can generate 2^31 addresses from 1 mnemonic phrase. Mnemonic phrase consists of 24 special words in defined order and can restore access to all generated addresses and private keys.<br/>Each address is identified by 3 main values:<ul><li>Private Key - your secret value, which should never be revealed</li><li>Public Key - public address to be published</li><li>Derivation index - index of generated address</li></ul></p><p>Tatum follows BIP44 specification and generates for Polygon wallet with derivation path m'/44'/966'/0'/0. More about BIP44 HD wallets can be found here - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki</a>.

        This operation needs the <strong>private key</strong> of the blockchain address.

      description: |
        To maintain the highest security level, Tatum requires X-API-Key HTTP header.
        This X-API-Key represents identification of the plan and can be used by 1 developer or per environment.
        Each X-API-Key is bound to the test or production blockchains.

        Connecting without an X-API-Key results in the creation of an API Key tied to your IP Address.
        This API Key is limited to 5req/s and 10M credits, these limits are renewed the 1st day of each month and are applicable to both testnet and mainnet.
        To differentiate between testnet and mainnet, please supply a ?type=testnet|mainnet query parameter with your calls, otherwise the api key will default to mainnet.
        You do not need to supply an API key in the X-API-Key header.
